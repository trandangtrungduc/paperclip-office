# Paperclip Office

A 2D pixel-art Electron desktop app that visualizes a [Paperclip](https://paperclip.ai) AI company as a living office building. Agents, projects, issues, costs, and approvals stream in from a real Paperclip instance and animate across a multi-floor canvas, with React panels for structured metrics, activity, and drill-in modals.

## Setup in 1 minute

1. Start a Paperclip instance (local): [paperclipai/paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip)
2. Install dependencies and run the app:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. In the connection screen, keep the default URL `http://localhost:3100` (or paste your hosted URL), then click **Connect**.
4. Pick your company and you are in.

For local Paperclip in trusted mode, API key can be left empty.

> **Note:** Install Paperclip first, and keep it in the default home path (`/home/<username>`).
> **Windows users:** Run this project through WSL (Ubuntu recommended) for the supported Windows workflow.

## Why this is easy

- **One-click local setup:** URL is prefilled as `http://localhost:3100`
- **Built for live data:** pulls REST snapshot + WebSocket updates from Paperclip
- **Connection memory:** app saves your last URL and selected company for faster reconnects
- **No CORS headaches:** all networking runs in Electron main process

## What this app shows

- Agents moving and working in a pixel office
- Project, issue, goal, and approval activity as it happens
- Cost and usage signals in side panels and modals

Think of it as an ambient "company status" window for your Paperclip company.

## Development scope

The PixiJS canvas and sprite assets are **frozen**. Do not modify:

- `src/renderer/components/game/` — canvas rendering
- `src/renderer/assets/` — sprites and texture maps

Active development targets:

- `src/renderer/components/layout/` — right panel enhancements, new left panel sections
- `src/renderer/components/modals/` — overlay detail views
- `src/renderer/stores/` — new store slices for dashboard, costs, etc.
- `src/main/paperclip/client.ts` — new API endpoint methods
- `src/main/index.ts` — new IPC handlers
- `src/shared/` — new IPC channels, event types, shared types

## Data flow

```
Paperclip WebSocket → Main process → EventNormalizer → IPC
                                                        ↓
                                           useIpcEvents hook
                                                        ↓
                                             Zustand officeStore
                                                        ↓
                                      React panels + PixiJS canvas re-render
```

Initial load fetches all entities in parallel (`agents`, `projects`, `issues`, `goals`, `approvals`, `costs/summary`, `activity`, `routines`, `plugins`) into a `CompanySnapshot`, then the WebSocket takes over for live updates.

## Engineering rules

1. All API calls live in `src/main/paperclip/client.ts` — the renderer never calls Paperclip directly.
2. All IPC channels are declared in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts` — no magic strings.
3. Raw Paperclip events are normalized to `NormalizedOfficeEvent` in `event-normalizer.ts` before crossing IPC.
4. The renderer is store-driven — PixiJS components read from `officeStore` and never fetch data.
5. Test the event normalizer and snapshot loader thoroughly — they are the core logic.
